                      - Enginuity 0.4.1 Beta -
            Open-Source ECU Tuning -- www.enginuity.org


PLEASE MAKE SURE TO READ RELEASE _NOTES.TXT_ EACH TIME YOU DOWNLOAD
A NEW VERSION OF ENGINUITY. IMPORTANT NOTICES, KNOWN ISSUES AND
NEW FEATURES WILL BE DISCUSSED.

Enginuity is a full featured Engine Control Unit editing application 
for tuning virtually any manufacturer, meant to be used in conjuction
with ECU flash and dump utilities. Enginuity will give you full 
control over timing, fuel, boost and many other parameters in your 
ECU, competing with very expensive and proprietary software. Enginuity 
will remove your need for piggyback systems designed to control these 
functions, and, in most cases, work as well as or better than any 
stand alone engine management. Reflashing your stock ECU also has the 
added benefit of a manufacturer tested base map, giving you top notch 
performance and saving time tuning idle and low throttle applications
while retaining all of the benefit of the research and development
manufacturer's spend millions of dollars on.

Enginuity is currently in BETA TEST status, meaning it is not 
thoroughly tested and not intended for use by inexperienced users. In 
addition to being incomplete and untested, only experienced tuners 
with the required tools (ie, wideband oxygen sensor) should modify an 
ECU image. As with any engine management, changes could result in 
severe engine damage. Use at your own risk.

Documentation is available at http://wiki.enginuity.org and the
official Enginuity FAQ can be found at
http://www.enginuity.org/about444.html. Please be aware that as 
Enginuity is still in beta status and changing frequently, 
documentation may be incomplete or out of date.

This release includes a couple minor fixes to the tuning interface and
major enhancements to the datalogger.

-----------------------
- 3d graph
  - Java3d over most VNC implementations will show a blank JFrame
  - You MUST have up to date graphics drivers that support OpenGL 1.2 
  - Expect ~200 megs of usage when using 3d graphing
  - Expect possible memory leaks when using 3d graphing
  - There are some problems with cell selection in 3d graphs
