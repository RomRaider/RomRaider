            Open-Source ECU Tuning -- www.romraider.com


PLEASE MAKE SURE TO READ RELEASE _NOTES.TXT_ EACH TIME YOU DOWNLOAD
A NEW VERSION OF ROMRAIDER. IMPORTANT NOTICES, KNOWN ISSUES AND
NEW FEATURES WILL BE DISCUSSED.

RomRaider is a full featured Engine Control Unit editing application
for tuning virtually any manufacturer, meant to be used in conjunction
with ECU flash and dump utilities. RomRaider will give you full
control over timing, fuel, boost and many other parameters in your
ECU, competing with very expensive and proprietary software. RomRaider
will remove your need for piggyback systems designed to control these
functions, and, in most cases, work as well as or better than any
stand alone engine management. Reflashing your stock ECU also has the
added benefit of a manufacturer tested base map, giving you top notch
performance and saving time tuning idle and low throttle applications
while retaining all of the benefit of the research and development
manufacturer's spend millions of dollars on.

RomRaider is currently in BETA TEST status, meaning it is not
thoroughly tested and not intended for use by inexperienced users. In
addition to being incomplete and untested, only experienced tuners
with the required tools (ie, wideband oxygen sensor) should modify an
ECU image. As with any engine management, changes could result in
severe engine damage. Use at your own risk.

Documentation is available at http://wiki.romraider.com and the
official RomRaider FAQ can be found at
http://www.romraider.com/about444.html. Please be aware that as
RomRaider is still in beta status and changing frequently,
documentation may be incomplete or out of date.

  - Fixed Learning Table Values reading ECU def problem for 6-cyl cars.


0.5.7 RC1 (08/05/2013)
----------------------------------

[1] New Logger features require added parameters in the logger definition file.
Therefore the minimum version of logger.xml is 155.  A warning will be displayed
if the version is below this prompting the user to update.

[2] The settings XML file can be stored in the RomRaider directory as an alternate
location.  This allows multiple customized installations to exist each with their
own settings.

- Logger
  - Added feature to read DTC via SSM connection [*1]
  - Added feature to adjust the global timing and AC on/off idle RPM values [*1]
  - Added feature to read ECU specific Learning Table Values [*1]
  - Added feature to allow user to define conversion formulas for Phidget sensors
  - TXS plugin update: by nitros
  - changed QueryManager to break TCU queries up as TCU doesn't support long CAN queries
  - support for signed integer values added [*1]
  - support for non-contiguous multi-byte parameters added [*1]
  - corrections to ISO15765 support, fixed debug messages and array index problem.
  - changed SSM test application to write bytes rather than blocks
  - changed SSM test application to allow selection of byte or block reads
  - update PLX sensor types to drop data for unknown sensor address 4032
  - force some font styles to plain as Linux seems to use bold as default

Operational Notes
    - Since RomRaider relies on various externally provided classes and vendor
      libraries, the 64bit Java VM is not supported.  The RomRaider installer and
      Editor will issue warnings if a 64bit Java VM is detected and advise the
      user to uninstall it and install the 32bit Java VM.  It is unlikely that
      64bit Java VM will even be supported as all external classes and vendor
      libraries must be compiled for native 64bit operation. See note 3 for an
      example.
    - To log External sensors only, un-select both the ECU and TCU checkbox on
      the Logger menu bar.  Then switch to the Externals tab and check the items
      to be logged.  The log Externals only setting is not retained between
      logging sessions.
    - The use of ISO15765 requires a J2534 compliant cable.  Since the J2534
      specification only defines Windows 32bit systems as a valid platform,
      Linux systems are not officially supported.  When/if a Linux J2534 driver
      becomes available then support can be enabled for non-Windows platforms. 


0.5.6 RC6 (03/24/2013)
----------------------------------

- Editor
  - fix for various Table Compare operations: by scotthew
  - added a Java 64bit VM check and warning: by lizzardo [*1]

  - fix to allow logging of External sensors only (with no ECU connection) [*2]
  - refactor to allow easier addition of other future Logging protocols
  - added ISO15765 protocol support on Windows platform [*3]
  - added a user Setting to Logger to force English US number format in log files
  - fix for issue #4 (multiple Query Managers could be started)
  - update 'Log to file' button to switch between 'Start/Stop' in the label
  - add a rudimentary test app to read some OBD-II parameters [*4]
  - reformat (shorten) display of Profile and log file names in Logger title bar 

- Application Installer
  - added a Java 64bit VM check and warning during installation: by lizzardo [*1]

      Linux systems are not officially supported.  When/if a Linux J2534 driver
      becomes available then support can be enabled for non-Windows platforms. 
[4] - This rudimentary test app ONLY works with J2534 compliant cables and ONLY
      supports the ISO15765 protocol.  It can currently read out the vehicle
      information and any active DTCs.  The app can only be started from a
      command window in the RomRaider directory using the following syntax:
      java -cp RomRaider.jar com.romraider.io.j2534.api.TestJ2534IsoTp [j2534dll]
               where [j2534dll] is a valid J2534 DLL library name, default is
               to use the Tactrix Openport 2.0 library

- J2534 API supports searching all available devices and if none found will
  default to serial. J2534 settings are stored and loaded through the
  settings file
- Including com4j-x86.dll to ensure it is present in the install directory
  to avoid write permission issues on Win7
- Created a new J2534DllLocator class based on JNA and removed third-party
  registry Jar
- Added extra LOGGER.debug statements to assist with troubleshooting
- Corrected serial connection close() call in all serial plug-ins as
  exceptions were being thrown
- Changed QueryManager logic to try and deal with duplicate log entries
  caused by high speed logging, it may still need some work
- Added Logger definition version to Help->About menu
- Updated Dyno control panel to look for cars_def.xml & .dtd in three
  possible locations:
    1 - the directory where the logger.xml file lives (preferred location)
    2 - the directory where the user stores their logging profiles
    3 - the RomRaider installation directory
- Fixed up the Parameter List Show/Hide state when opening the Logger
  such that the list on each tab is set the same as the last selected
  tab's state

--- Editor ---
- Fixed Test App's ability to walk through addresses and cross the
  0xf7fff 0xf8000 boundary correctly

        Will not do much but show "Images are equal.")
    - Select Edit->Compare Images...
    - Select the two images to compare and click the compare button
    - Results are displayed in the results pane
- scotthew@romraider.forum Added ability to save as repository.  This
   basically dumps the tables into a file structure represented by the
   categories and saves the tables as a text file.  Use this for tracking
   changes made to ROMs using a revision control system.
- scotthew@romraider.forum Added ability to change the clipboard format.
  Options are Default, Airboy's, and Custom. Custom formats are specified

  and restored between sessions.  INFO should be the normal state to keep the
  rr_system.log file in-check.
- Moved the COM port Auto Refresh checkbox to the Settings menu.
- Added a Logger startup Progress Bar as loading plugins sometimes takes time.
- Added colour to "Log to File" button. Red when recording and green when not.
  * Button colours may not appear correctly as this is platform dependent. Colours
    may show as a border rather than a fill.
  Also changed the colours used for the connection state:
    * Red Square = recording to file (used to be green)
    * Green = connected and ready to record (used to blue)
    * Blue  = connection to ECU in progress (used to be red)
    * Red with X = disconnected (used to be red)
- Added colour to "Un-select ALL" button.  Yellow so it stands out.
  * Button colours may not appear correctly as this is platform dependent. Colour
    may show as a border rather than a fill.

  does not match one of the switch states according to the definition then a
  warning is presented and the table is locked from editing.
- Added ROM Checksum validation on image open for 32 bit ROMs.  An ERROR message
  is presented warning not to use the ROM image as it may be corrupt.
- Added ROM Checksum calculation for 32 bit ROMs.  Upon file save the new
  Checksums (if not previously disabled) are written to the ROM.
- Added a ROM Edit Stamp to 32 bit ROMs consisting of the YYMMDD and an
  incremental count value.  This Edit Stamp is displayed in the View->ROM
  properties menu item.
