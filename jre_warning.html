	<h1>Java Runtime Warning</h1>

<p>This application and its installer both require a 32-bit Java Runtime Environment, even if 
the operating system is 64-bit.</p>

<p>If this installer is run with a 64-bit version of Java, it will not complete successfully.</p>

<p>If RomRaider is run with a 64-bit version of Java, it will not function properly.</p>

<p>Please ensure that a 32-bit version of Java with a minimum version of 1.6 is installed.</p>

<p>For further information, please consult the <a href="http://www.romraider.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=5">RomRaider Troubleshooting Forum</a></p>
